# Gitnapped

> Find out why you didn't sleep – a Git commit timeline analyzer

Gitnapped is a command-line tool that analyzes your Git commit history across multiple repositories. It provides insights into your coding patterns, helping you understand where your time is spent across projects.

## What Does It Mean to Get Gitnapped?

Picture this: it’s 5 PM, you’re ready to call it a day, but then you think, “Just one more commit…” Next thing you know, it’s 2 AM, and you’re knee-deep in code. That’s being gitnapped! Gitnapped (the tool) helps you spot these moments by analyzing your commit history—showing you when Git’s magic stole your sleep.

> So, have you gitnapped yourself lately?

## Features

## Full disclosure

Let’s be real.

Gitnapped is a fancy wrapper for Git’s command-line magic. But that’s the point! It takes the heavy lifting out of analyzing your commit history, so you can see when you’ve been gitnapped by your code—those late-night commit sprees or weekend coding binges. Understand your coding patterns, reclaim your sleep, and maybe have a laugh along the way.
